  <h2 class="home-heading mb-3">What is PNR?</h2>
  <p>PNR is short name for 'Passenger Name Record'. It is a record in the database of Indian Railways against which the journey details for a passenger, or a group of passengers are stored. Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) also maintains information like current PNR status of the passengers, availability of berths in all classes for the next 60 days and static enquiries like Train Between Important Stations, Reservations Rules, Fares, Refund, and Rules etc When a reserved railway ticket is booked for a train in Indian Railways, all the details of passengers are stored in relational database of centralized reservation system. These details are associated with a unique ten digit number. This reference number is called PNR. PNR number is generally printed at the top left corner of the printed tickets. In case of the E â€“ Ticket, it is mentioned at top in separate cell. Passenger's personal information like name, age, gender etc. is saved in the database against this reference number. It includes columns to store booking status and current status of the ticket. As we know every train has limited number of seats, sometime one may not get a confirmed reserved ticket. The current status of such a waitlist (W/L) ticket changes when there is any availability of reserved seats due to cancellation. This new current reservation status is generally known as PNR status.</p>
